            <h2>Problem:</h2>
            <p>One of the biggest challenges facing science journalists is the ability to quickly contextualize peer-reviewed journal articles that they are reporting on deadline. A science reporter must rapidly get a sense of what has come before in a field they may not know well, understand whether the new paper represents a significant advance or not, and establish whether this finding is an outlier, falls in a camp or is part of the field’s consensus.</p>
            <h2>Solution:</h2>
            <p>SCIENCE SURVEYOR is an algorithm-based method to help science journalists rapidly and effectively characterize the rich literature for any topic they might cover, as a way to inform and assist news judgment and reporting. We see the development of these algorithms as having the potential to greatly improve science news coverage by making it more independent, contextualized and investigative. News stories could better convey the incremental character of science, its complexity, its nuance. If successful, the methodology we devise could have wider use. Scientists and other researchers could use it to improve communication about their fields and practice within their fields. Members of the public could use it to engage with the specialized literature in new ways.<br><br></p>

            <p>In September SCIENCE SURVEYOR will begin its second year of research with an extremely generous Magic Grant from the Helen Gurley Brown Institute for Media Innovation. SCIENCE SURVEYOR was chosen as the <a href="http://brown.columbia.edu/">Brown Institute</a>’s first Flagship Project. The expanded team aims to develop a methodology and to then test that methodology in interactive visualizations of several case studies from climate science and neuroscience.<br><br>In August the principal investigators met in Stanford to plan the upcoming year and brainstorm about their approach. Several graduate students and post-docs in computer science, linguistics, sociology and education will soon join the team and start devising the methodologies.<br><br>Please check back here for more updates soon!<br><br></p>

            <h1>2014 - 2015</h1>
            <p>SCIENCE SURVEYOR was awarded its initial Magic Grant for 2014—2015. Over the last year, the original team—Holloway, Tenen, Saldarriaga and Kurgan—conducted an extensive literature review, looking at prior art and work in the realm of citation and network analysis and characterizations and visualizations of the scientific literature.<br><br>
            <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/Thoroughly_Fried.png">
            <br>The team then began to experiment on a small, clean corpus of peer-reviewed papers—the Archive of Computational Linguistics—that was generously donated by Dragomir Radev. The team worked on devising ways of depicting “centrality,” a measure of how related and similar a paper is to its larger field, based on language and citations, and how that changes over time. The team developed a methodology—with the help of Phillip Polefrone and Shuheng Gong. And they created two innovative visualizations:<br><br></p>

The two have deep expertise in natural language processing and characterizing the scientific literature as well as deep knowledge of the sociology of science. The ensuing collaboration offers SCIENCE SURVEYOR its greatest chance of success.</p>
